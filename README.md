### Task 01: What could be the better approach to choose the range in the bisection method?

In traditional bisection method, a function f(x) has at least one root if it is continuous and changes sign in the interval [a,b]. In mathematical term, if

    f(a)*f(b)<0, then there must be at least one root c in the interval [a,b], where f(c)=0
